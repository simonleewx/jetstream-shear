# jetstream-shear

The Python files here produce the analyses presented in "Increased shear in the North Atlantic upper level jet stream over 
the past four decades" (Simon H. Lee, Paul D. Williams, and Thomas H. A. Frame: Nature, 2019). 

The datasets used are available from the NCAR RDA website for JRA-55 and ERA-Interim (https://rda.ucar.edu/) 
and the NOAA ftp server for NCEP/NCAR (ftp://ftp.cdc.noaa.gov/Datasets/ncep.reanalysis/).
